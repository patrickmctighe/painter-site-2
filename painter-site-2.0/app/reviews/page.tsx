            "As a landlord, I've hired a number of painters through the years, but I have to say that using Patrick was the best experience I've ever had. He is not only great at painting, but he is incredibly neat and tidy. Not a speck left anywhere. He brought our project in on time and did an excellent job. I highly recommend him."

If he tells you he'll do something, it will be beautifully done and your space will be spotless - his clean-up skills are as good as his painting!"
